The need for exchange is about the sharing of information and knowledge, especially with those who are interested in reciprocity. This need is not about mere chit-chat or social banter, but instead focuses on something of value. Using many guises, this form of exchange finds expression through activities like teaching, meaningful discussions, energetic connections with friends, the giving of gifts, intimate expressions of love, and so forth. There is an interest in truth and integrity with this need, and this often guides the method of exchange. 

This need expresses itself through skin contact, expenditures of time, and social interaction. With skin contact there's generosity involving physical touch and the expression that can give. With time, the old expression of spending "quality time" with someone comes into play. With social interaction, there's an open flow of communication and general receptivity to others. All of the forms of exchange are important to this need.

####In the positive pole
- people with this need can be a valuable source of knowledge to others, producing both great teachers and students. There is a wonderful openness in all forms of communication here, and an interest in working with others to achieve a common goal. Exchange in general is a vital means of expression that all humans need in order to stay balanced and connected.

####In the negative pole
- there's inappropriate communication, such as slander and gossip. There can be an unwillingness to exchange information and an urge to keep it a secret. Negativity and cynicism can predominate here, as well as the use of information against others or simply lying and deceiving.
