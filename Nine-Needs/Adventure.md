Associated with the Goal of Growth, the need for Adventure drives people to seek various forms of stimulation. The pursuit of exciting new experiences and an inherent craving for any form of adrenaline rush are common components of this need.  

People with a need for Adventure tend to be independent, optimistic, confident, and possess an exuberant zest for life. They love to take risks or meet challenges, and the sense of drama that normally accompanies such enterprises is enormously satisfying to them. In the negative pole, this flair for drama can be used inappropriately, leading to either the creation of crisis for effect, a reckless regard for life and limb, or a self-destructive pattern of compulsive disorders involving alcohol, drugs, sex, and excessive spending.  

A need for Adventure is occasionally chosen when souls have fallen asleep at the wheel too many times in previous past lives. The need pokes and prods people to stay awake or to seek a higher degree of presence in their lifetime. Those who have become too attached to security will often choose a need of adventure in order to add excitement to what normally might be a safe but boring life. There is a push with this need to meet the world head on, and to explore agreements, engage the life task, and complete karma.

The thrill of discovery is tantamount with this need and occasionally an intoxication can develop from the sheer exhilaration of it all. This can be both fulfilling and exhausting, especially when the hunger for new experience becomes insatiable. At some point regarding certain experiences, the realization must be made that the "tank is running on empty" and there's nothing to gain from endless repetition. 

Adventure can manifest in many different ways, from a love of traveling, to an entrepreneur starting a new company.  Roller coasters enthusiasts, recreational drug users, fans of Indiana Jones movies, or readers of horror/sci-fi novels might all have a need for Adventure in common, as well as people who seem driven to frequently change jobs, spouses, or the places where they live. Falling madly in love with someone is one of the more pleasant expressions of this need

This chakra focuses on the emotional self and is driven in the pursuit of pleasurable experiences, both sensual and sexual. In short, the main goal is to enjoy life. This makes for a nice partnership with the need for Adventure.

####On the positive side
- this chakra/need combination leads to creative and resourceful people who live life fully and with gusto.

####In the negative
- hedonistic behavior can take root. There can be great suffering in life and difficulty in letting go of negative attitudes. Examining the root causes of emotional distress can be the first step towards healing. Finding something that is enjoyed and doing it passionately can also help in dissipating negative energy. Exploring the four pillars, especially True Play, can be of enormous assistance here.
