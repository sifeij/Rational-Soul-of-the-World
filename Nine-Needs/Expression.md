People with this need are happiest when opportunities to express creativity are given full reign. There is a desire to realize the full potential of their creative gifts, whether through the use of words, speech, art, music, or dancing. Indeed, true artistry can be realized with this need.

On the other hand, sometimes expression will exceed the boundaries of good taste, and like some Sages in the negative pole, the individual creation will be crafted more for its shock value than anything else.  

####In the positive pole
- individual creativity is used for the benefit of self and others. Expression releases the inner sanctuaries of people, and this helps them achieve a greater understanding of both themselves and the world. In short, it shows who we are and allows the expression of any talent, whatever that may be.

####In the negative pole
- a self-centered attitude prevails, and individual expression is thoughtlessly thrust into the space of others. Temper tantrums and moodiness can dominate, along with a childish insistence on having things go one way. Various forms of lying and deception can also find expression here. In worse case scenarios, self-destruction can occur in a final act of expression that destroys the self.
