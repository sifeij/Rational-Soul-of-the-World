People with this need tend to be tribal and family oriented. They are highly social and will use just about any excuse to justify gathering a group of people together.  In short, they do not like to be alone.  

####In the positive pole
- these people are happiest when they are sharing with others, both emotionally and mentally. Physically, there is almost always an open invitation from them to come share their world in one capacity or another. Not surprisingly, people with this need make great hosts, and excel when they are given the responsibility of organizing community events, parties, or other social functions. They also seem to have an natural affinity for working with children.  

There are many layers to this need, ranging from feelings of devotion to a higher being, to a need to be with a tribe or greater community, such as other Michael students. Associations with family members and true friends represents another layer, along with a deep desire for intimacy. 

Regardless of role, there is an obvious talent for socializing here and an apparent ease in making good impressions on others. Friends or family members who are less outgoing can quickly feel overwhelmed by these gregarious, social butterflies, who endlessly try to thrust them into encounters with other people.  

####In the negative pole
- there can be a desperate neediness that drives others away. This sort of behavior can lead to increasing levels of shallowness and indiscriminatingly approving of and accepting the company of anyone just to avoid being alone.  In the most negative extremes, this can sometimes manifest in criminal behavior in order to attract attention.
