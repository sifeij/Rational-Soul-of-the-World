This need is popular with those who are determined to push themselves in all endeavors. People with this need really see the big picture and they're forever looking towards the future. The focus is on growth and expansion, with a continuous desire to either create something new or build on something old. Depending on soul age and individual goals, this can manifest anywhere from creating vast real estate empires, amassing enormous wealth, building an art collection, or advancing science. Plumbing the depths of spiritual wisdom, for example, can be another expression of this need and something perhaps pursued by an older soul. In short, people with this need will try to expand themselves on all levels.

####In the positive pole 

In the positive pole there's a strong desire to make a difference in the world, and to bring recognition to other people or advance awareness about important cultural movements or far-reaching societal concerns. Art, music, literature, science, and even spirituality, are all noble endeavors that a person in expansion might want to champion. This need is virtually limitless in its scope and motivates people to strive towards the attainment of true wisdom and authenticity. 

####In the negative pole
In the negative pole, expansion can result in compulsive greed and false pride. The person becomes so convinced of their superiority in all things that they lose their sense of reality and spiritually slide back to where they started. There's also a tendency to become confused by the complexity they have created and petty judgments often arise. Obesity is another distorted manifestation of this need, along with quirky obsessions to hoard things or various forms of indiscriminate growth, such as cancer.
