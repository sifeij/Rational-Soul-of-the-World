###Choice - Alan Watts

[Conversation with Myself](https://youtu.be/D7CH9cRN8Rg)

You do not know where your decisions come from up, they pop up like hiccups. And when you make a decision, people have a great deal of anxiety when a making decision. Did I think this over long enough? Did I take enough data into consideration? If you think it through, you find you never could take enough data into consideration, the data for a decision for any given situation is infinite. What you do is you go through the motions of what you will do about this, but, worriers are people who think of all the variables beyond their control and what might happen...
 
Choice is the act of hesitation that we make before making a decision, it is a mental wobbling, and so we are always in a dither of doubt, as to whether we are behaving the right way or doing the right thing, and lack a certain kind of self confidence.  And if you see you lack self confidence you will make mistakes through sheer fumbling, if you do have self confidence you may carry get away with doing entirely the wrong thing.  
 
You have to regard yourself as a cloud in the flesh, because, you see, clouds never make mistakes. Did you ever see a cloud that is misshapen or a badly designed wave? No, they always do the right thing. But if you would treat yourself for awhile as a cloud or wave and realize you can't make a mistake, no matter what you do, even if you do something that seems to be totally disastrous, it will all come out in the wash somehow or other.  
 
Then through this capacity you will develop a kind of confidence, through confidence you will be able to trust your own intuition. This is the middle way, of knowing it has nothing to do with your decision to do this or not, whether you decide that you can't make a mistake or don't decide it, it is true anyway, that you are like cloud and water. And through that realization without overcompensating in the other direction, you will come to the point of where you begin to be on good terms with your own being and to be able to trust your own brain. 

Each of the life is the right one. Every path is the right path. Everything could have been anything else. And it would have just as much meaning.
