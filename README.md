# Rational-Soul-of-the-World

The lower worlds of M.E.S.T. (Matter, Energy,Space, and Time), which are a mixture of matter and spirit. In these lower worlds Souls take on various bodies including the etheric or subconscious or primitive body, the mental body, causal, seed or memory body, astral or emotional body, and of course the physical body. These are worlds of duality where you cannot have **love** without **hate**, **mountains** without **valleys**, and **courage** without **fear**.
