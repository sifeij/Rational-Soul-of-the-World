The Server is naturally inspired to make the world a better place to live in. He derives his primary satisfaction by heartfelt concern for the quality of life. His foremost fulfillment is to make things more comfortable in a material sense for himself and those around him.

This Role was originally called "Slave", but this word gives a connotation to the Role which is not necessarily valid. In the Negative Pole of -Bondage, a Server can be like a slave in the sense that he feels as if he is carrying the world as a burden on his shoulders. He may feel like he is a lowly drudge who is yoked to a menial job. He may feel that his whole life is filled with one obligatory chore after another, just like a slave in past cultures. But the Positive Pole of Service is one of helping, caring, nurturing, sustaining, attending, aiding, and consoling. Of the Roles, the Server would probably be considered the most "feminine" in our culture, because of these "mothering" qualities.

Of the Roles, the Server is the most just plain human. There are more Servers than any other Role. They are common man, your everyday person. Servers are the "backbone" of society. Metaphorically speaking, they are the back of the body of mankind, bearing up the burdens of the world to make it a better world. Servers identify with mankind because they feel for the sufferings of others — and mankind does indeed suffer. Servers are more aware of this than other Roles. When they manifest their highest nature, Servers want to ease this suffering by taking the problems upon themselves, and doing what is necessary to alleviate the pain. They are neither too proud to ask for help for themselves if they need it nor to give aid to others in need. Servers true to their essence will give "the shirt off their back" if requested by a needy person. They are normally very charitable toward others, even if they themselves are not well off.
